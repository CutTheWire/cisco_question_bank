## 13. What type of ACL offers greater flexibility and control over network access?
---
- [ ] Numbered Standard
- [ ] Named Standard
- [x] Extended
- [ ] Flexible

> **Explanation:** Extended ACLs offer greater flexibility and control over filtering network traffic.

## 14. What is the quickest way to remove a single ACE from a named ACL?
---
- [x] Use the no keyword and the sequence number of the ACE to be removed.
- [ ] Copy the ACL into a text editor, remove the ACE, then copy the ACL back into the router.
- [ ] Create a new ACL with a different number and apply the new ACL to the router interface.
- [ ] Use the no access-list command to remove the entire ACL, then recreate it without the ACE.

> **Explanation:** Named ACL ACEs can be removed using the no command followed by the sequence number.

## 15. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator is configuring a standard IPv4 ACL. What is the effect after the command no access-list 10 is entered?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-1.png)
- [x] ACL 10 is removed from the running configuration.
- [ ] ACL 10 is removed from both the running configuration and the interface Fa0/1.
- [ ] ACL 10 is disabled on Fa0/1.
- [ ] ACL 10 will be disabled and removed after R1 restarts.

> **Explanation:** The no access-list command removes the ACL from the running configuration immediately.

## 16. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator has configured ACL 9 as shown. Users on the 172.31.1.0 /24 network cannot forward traffic through router CiscoVille. What is the most likely cause of the traffic failure?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-2.png)
- [ ] The established keyword is not specified.
- [x] The sequence of the ACEs is incorrect.
- [ ] The port number for the traffic has not been identified with the eq keyword.
- [ ] The permit statement specifies an incorrect wildcard mask.

> **Explanation:** The sequence of ACEs needs modification to permit specific traffic from network 172.31.1.0 /24.

## 17. A network administrator needs to configure a standard ACL so that only the workstation of the administrator with the IP address 192.168.15.23 can access the virtual terminal of the main router. Which two configuration commands can achieve the task? (Choose two.)
---
- [x] Router1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.15.23 0.0.0.0
- [ ] Router1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.15.23 0.0.0.255
- [ ] Router1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.15.23 255.255.255.255
- [x] Router1(config)# access-list 10 permit host 192.168.15.23
- [ ] Router1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.15.23 255.255.255.0

> **Explanation:** The wildcard mask 0.0.0.0 or the host keyword allows filtering for a specific IP address.

## 18. Refer to the exhibit. Which command would be used in a standard ACL to allow only devices on the network attached to R2 G0/0 interface to access the networks attached to R1?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-3.png)
- [ ] access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.128 0.0.0.63
- [x] access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.96 0.0.0.31
- [ ] access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
- [ ] access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.63

> **Explanation:** The correct ACL is access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.96 0.0.0.31 for the R2 G0/0 network.

## 19. A network administrator is writing a standard ACL that will deny any traffic from the 172.16.0.0/16 network, but permit all other traffic. Which two commands should be used? (Choose two.)
---
- [x] Router(config)# access-list 95 deny 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255
- [x] Router(config)# access-list 95 permit any
- [ ] Router(config)# access-list 95 host 172.16.0.0
- [ ] Router(config)# access-list 95 172.16.0.0 255.255.255.255
- [ ] Router(config)# access-list 95 deny any

> **Explanation:** Use access-list 95 deny 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 to deny the 172.16.0.0/16 network and access-list 95 permit any to allow all other traffic.

## 20. Refer to the exhibit. An ACL was configured on R1 with the intention of denying traffic from subnet 172.16.4.0/24 into subnet 172.16.3.0/24. All other traffic into subnet 172.16.3.0/24 should be permitted. This standard ACL was then applied outbound on interface Fa0/0. Which conclusion can be drawn from this configuration?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-4.png)
- [ ] The ACL should be applied outbound on all interfaces of R1.
- [ ] The ACL should be applied to the FastEthernet 0/0 interface of R1 inbound to accomplish the requirements.
- [x] All traffic will be blocked, not just traffic from the 172.16.4.0/24 subnet.
- [ ] Only traffic from the 172.16.4.0/24 subnet is blocked, and all other traffic is allowed.
- [ ] An extended ACL must be used in this situation.

> **Explanation:** An implicit deny exists at the end of all ACLs, so the access-list 1 permit any command ensures only 172.16.4.0/24 is blocked.

## 21. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator needs to add an ACE to the TRAFFIC-CONTROL ACL that will deny IP traffic from the subnet 172.23.16.0/20. Which ACE will meet this requirement?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-5.png)
- [ ] 30 deny 172.23.16.0 0.0.15.255
- [ ] 15 deny 172.23.16.0 0.0.15.255
- [x] 5 deny 172.23.16.0 0.0.15.255
- [ ] 5 deny 172.23.16.0 0.0.255.255

> **Explanation:** The router parses ACEs from lowest to highest sequence number, so the entry with 5 deny is needed.

## 22. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator configures an ACL on the router. Which statement describes the result of the configuration?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-6.png)
- [x] An SSH connection is allowed from a workstation with IP 172.16.45.16 to a device with IP 192.168.25.18.
- [ ] An SSH connection is allowed from a workstation with IP 192.168.25.18 to a device with IP 172.16.45.16.
- [ ] A Telnet connection is allowed from a workstation with IP 192.168.25.18 to a device with IP 172.16.45.16.
- [ ] A Telnet connection is allowed from a workstation with IP 172.16.45.16 to a device with IP 192.168.25.18.

> **Explanation:** In extended ACLs, the first address is the source IP and the second is the destination. Port 22 is for SSH, while Telnet uses port 23.

## 23. Refer to the exhibit. What can be determined from this output?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-7.png)
- [ ] The ACL is missing the deny ip any any ACE.
- [ ] The ACL is only monitoring traffic destined for 10.23.77.101 from three specific hosts.
- [ ] Because there are no matches for line 10, the ACL is not working.
- [x] The router has not had any Telnet packets from 10.35.80.22 that are destined for 10.23.77.101.

> **Explanation:** The lack of matches for ACE 10 means that no Telnet packets have matched its conditions.

## 24. Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator wants to permit only host 192.168.1.1 /24 to be able to access the server 192.168.2.1 /24. Which three commands will achieve this using best ACL placement practices? (Choose three.)
---
![alt text](3~5/image-8.png)
- [x] R2(config)# interface fastethernet 0/0
- [x] R2(config)# access-list 101 permit ip host 192.168.1.1 host 192.168.2.1
- [x] R2(config-if)# ip access-group 101 in
- [ ] R2(config)# access-list 101 permit ip any any
- [ ] R2(config)# access-list 101 permit ip 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0
- [ ] R2(config-if)# ip access-group 101 out
- [ ] R2(config)# interface fastethernet 0/1

> **Explanation:** Place the ACL as close to the source of traffic as possible for better traffic control and minimal network overhead.

## 25. Consider the following access list. access-list 100 permit ip host 192.168.10.1 any access-list 100 deny icmp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any echo access-list 100 permit ip any any Which two actions are taken if the access list is placed inbound on a router Gigabit Ethernet port that has the IP address 192.168.10.254 assigned? (Choose two.)
---
- [ ] Only Layer 3 connections are allowed to be made from the router to any other network device.
- [ ] Devices on the 192.168.10.0/24 network are not allowed to reply to any ping requests.
- [ ] Devices on the 192.168.10.0/24 network can sucessfully ping devices on the 192.168.11.0 network.
- [x] A Telnet or SSH session is allowed from any device on the 192.168.10.0 into the router with this access list assigned.
- [x] Devices on the 192.168.10.0/24 network are allowed to reply to any ping requests.
- [ ] Only the network device assigned the IP address 192.168.10.1 is allowed to access the router.

## 26. Refer to the exhibit. The named ACL “Managers” already exists on the router. What will happen when the network administrator issues the commands that are shown in the exhibit?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-9.png)
- [x] The commands are added at the end of the existing Managers ACL.
- [ ] The commands overwrite the existing Managers ACL.
- [ ] The commands are added at the beginning of the existing Managers ACL.
- [ ] The network administrator receives an error that states that the ACL already exists.

## 27. In which TCP attack is the cybercriminal attempting to overwhelm a target host with half-open TCP connections?
---
- [ ] port scan attack
- [x] SYN flood attack
- [ ] session hijacking attack
- [ ] reset attack

> **Explanation:** In a TCP SYN flood attack, the attacker sends to the target host a continuous flood of TCP SYN session requests with a spoofed source IP address. The target host responds with a TCP-SYN-ACK to each of the SYN session requests and waits for a TCP ACK that will never arrive. Eventually the target is overwhelmed with half-open TCP connections.

## 28. Which protocol is attacked when a cybercriminal provides an invalid gateway in order to create a man-in-the-middle attack?
---
- [x] DHCP
- [ ] DNS
- [ ] ICMP
- [ ] HTTP or HTTPS
> **Explanation:** A cybercriminal could set up a rogue DHCP server that provides one or more of the following:
>
> - Wrong default gateway that is used to create a man-in-the-middle attack and allow the attacker to intercept data
> - Wrong DNS server that results in the user being sent to a malicious website
> - Invalid default gateway IP address that results in a denial of service attack on the DHCP client

## 29. Refer to the exhibit. An administrator has configured a standard ACL on R1 and applied it to interface serial 0/0/0 in the outbound direction. What happens to traffic leaving interface serial 0/0/0 that does not match the configured ACL statements?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-10.png)
- [x] The traffic is dropped.
- [ ] The source IP address is checked and, if a match is not found, traffic is routed out interface serial 0/0/1.
- [ ] The resulting action is determined by the destination IP address.
- [ ] The resulting action is determined by the destination IP address and port number

> **Explanation:** Any traffic that does not match one of the statements in an ACL has the implicit deny applied to it, which means the traffic is dropped.

## 30. Refer to the exhibit. The Gigabit interfaces on both routers have been configured with subinterface numbers that match the VLAN numbers connected to them. PCs on VLAN 10 should be able to print to the P1 printer on VLAN 12. PCs on VLAN 20 should print to the printers on VLAN 22. What interface and in what direction should you place a standard ACL that allows printing to P1 from data VLAN 10, but stops the PCs on VLAN 20 from using the P1 printer? (Choose two.)
---
![alt text](3~5/image-11.png)
- [ ] inbound
- [ ] R2 S0/0/1
- [x] R1 Gi0/1.12
- [x] outbound
- [ ] R1 S0/0/0
- [ ] R2 Gi0/1.20

>**Explanation:** A standard access list is commonly placed as close to the destination network as possible because access control expressions in a standard ACL do not include information about the destination network.
The destination in this example is printer VLAN 12 which has router R1 Gigabit subinterface 0/1/.12 as its gateway. A sample standard ACL that only allows printing from data VLAN 10 (192.168.10.0/24), for example, and no other VLAN would be as follows:
>
>R1(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
>R1(config)# access-list 1 deny any
>R1(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/1.12
>R1(config-if)# ip access-group 1 out
>

## 31. Which statement describes a characteristic of standard IPv4 ACLs?
---
- [ ] They are configured in the interface configuration mode.
- [ ] They can be configured to filter traffic based on both source IP addresses and source ports.
- [ ] They can be created with a number but not with a name.
- [x] They filter traffic based on source IP addresses only.

> **Explanation:** A standard IPv4 ACL can filter traffic based on source IP addresses only. Unlike an extended ACL, it cannot filter traffic based on Layer 4 ports. However, both standard and extended ACLs can be identified with either a number or a name, and both are configured in global configuration mode.

## 32. What is considered a best practice when configuring ACLs on vty lines?
---
- [x] Place identical restrictions on all vty lines.
- [ ] Remove the vty password since the ACL restricts access to trusted users.
- [ ] Apply the ip access-group command inbound.
- [ ] Use only extended access lists.

## 33. Refer to the exhibit. An administrator first configured an extended ACL as shown by the output of the show access-lists command. The administrator then edited this access-list by issuing the commands below. Router(config)# ip access-list extended 101 Router(config-ext-nacl)# no 20 Router(config-ext-nacl)# 5 permit tcp any any eq 22 Router(config-ext-nacl)# 20 deny udp any any Which two conclusions can be drawn from this new configuration?​ (Choose two.)
---
![alt text](3~5/image-12.png)
- [ ] TFTP packets will be permitted.​
- [x] Ping packets will be permitted.
- [ ] Telnet packets will be permitted.
- [x] SSH packets will be permitted.
- [ ] All TCP and UDP packets will be denied.​

> **Explanation:** After the editing, the final configuration is as follows:
> - Router# show access-lists
> - Extended IP access list 101
> - 5 permit tcp any any eq ssh
> - 10 deny tcp any any
> - 20 deny udp any any
> - 30 permit icmp any any
> - So, only SSH packets and ICMP packets will be permitted.​

## 34. Which set of access control entries would allow all users on the 192.168.10.0/24 network to access a web server that is located at 172.17.80.1, but would not allow them to use Telnet?
---
- [ ] access-list 103 deny tcp host 192.168.10.0 any eq 23 & access-list 103 permit tcp host 192.168.10.1 eq 80
- [ ] access-list 103 permit tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80 & access-list 103 deny tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 23
- [ ] access-list 103 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 host 172.17.80.1 & access-list 103 deny tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq telnet​​
- [x] access-list 103 permit tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 host 172.17.80.1 eq 80 & access-list 103 deny tcp ​192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 23

> **Explanation:** For an extended ACL to meet these requirements the following need to be included in the access control entries:
> - identification number in the range 100-199 or 2000-2699
> - permit or deny parameter
> - protocol
> - source address and wildcard
> - destination address and wildcard
> - port number or name

## 43. Which statement describes a difference between the operation of inbound and outbound ACLs?
---
- [x] Inbound ACLs are processed before the packets are routed while outbound ACLs are processed after the routing is completed.
- [ ] In contrast to outbound ALCs, inbound ACLs can be used to filter packets with multiple criteria.
- [ ] On a network interface, more than one inbound ACL can be configured but only one outbound ACL can be configured.
- [ ] Inbound ACLs can be used in both routers and switches but outbound ACLs can be used only on routers.

## 44. What effect would the Router1(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp 172.16.4.0 0.0.0.255 any eq www command have when implemented inbound on the f0/0 interface?
---
- [ ] All TCP traffic is permitted, and all other traffic is denied.
- [x] Traffic originating from 172.16.4.0/24 is permitted to all TCP port 80 destinations.
- [ ] All traffic from 172.16.4.0/24 is permitted anywhere on any port.
- [ ] The command is rejected by the router because it is incomplete.

## 45. Which ACE will permit a packet that originates from any network and is destined for a web server at 192.168.1.1?
---
- [x] access-list 101 permit tcp any host 192.168.1.1 eq 80
- [ ] access-list 101 permit tcp host 192.168.1.1 eq 80 any
- [ ] access-list 101 permit tcp host 192.168.1.1 any eq 80
- [ ] access-list 101 permit tcp any eq 80 host 192.168.1.1

## 46. Refer to the exhibit. A new network policy requires an ACL denying FTP and Telnet access to a Corp file server from all interns. The address of the file server is 172.16.1.15 and all interns are assigned addresses in the 172.18.200.0/24 network. After implementing the ACL, no one in the Corp network can access any of the servers. What is the problem?
---
![alt text](3~5/image-14.png)
- [ ] Inbound ACLs must be routed before they are processed.
- [x] The ACL is implicitly denying access to all the servers.
- [ ] Named ACLs require the use of port numbers.
- [ ] The ACL is applied to the interface using the wrong direction.

## 47. A technician is tasked with using ACLs to secure a router. When would the technician use the access-class 20 in configuration option or command?
---
